# TrafficLight
A sample project use Apple CoreML &amp; Vision to detect traffic lights

# How to use
This project doesn't contain a ML model, that means you can't just download and run, you need to find a model or train one by yourself.
The One I used for testing is from davidbrai's project [Recognizing Traffic Lights with Deep Learning] (https://github.com/davidbrai/deep-learning-traffic-lights)
David's Model works great, it's the my first recommendation if you wanna try this code.

You can use Apple's coremltools to convert it to a MLModel, set the input/output interface you want,
and integrate your model with my code.

# About
TrafficLight Project provide full support for video capture, AVCapture arguments setting, and CoreML, Vision Integration,
it's more about a sample or a toy，dont try it in realworld driving.
